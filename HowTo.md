How to install Ruby and Run Quandrax on Windows
===============================================

This will provide step-by-step instructions, from getting Ruby to starting your EU3 game.

1. Download the RubyInstaller from http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/. The latest version is at the top - it's currently Ruby 1.9.3-p385.
2. Click the downloaded file to install Ruby.
3. Once it's installed, go to the Quandrax sourceforge page at http://sourceforge.net/projects/quandrax/ and click the green "Download" button.
4. Double click the zip file, and choose where to put it.
5. Find your CK2 savegame file, and put it in the same folder that you just extracted Quandrax to (the one that includes the file "quandrax.rb").
6. Double-click quandrax.rb. If you haven't run it before, it'll prompt you for the expansion you have installed. Otherwise, it'll run (with minimal output)
7. Techno-magically, there will be a new file with the same name as your CK2 file, but ending in EU3.
8. Put that file in your EU3 save game folder.
9. Start EU3, and load the saved file.
10. Conquer world.
