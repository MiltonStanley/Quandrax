# What is Quandrax?

   This is the QUick ANd Dirty paRAdoX converter, a project to create a single,
   unified save game converter. Currently, it is primarily focused on CK2-EU3,
   as that seems to be the biggest need.

## How Do I Use it?

   Put your CK2 save game in the same folder as quandrax.rb, and then run 
   Quandrax. It will create an EU3 save game with the same filename. Put this
   in your EU3 save game folder.
   If you don't want to do it yourself, or don't have Ruby installed, feel free 
   to email me at quandraxproject@gmail.com. I will convert it for you and email it back.
