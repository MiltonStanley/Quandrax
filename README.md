What is Quandrax?
-----------------
Quandrax is the program to create a single, unified save game converter for the fantastic suite of historical strategy games published by Paradox Interactive.

Getting Started
---------------
1. Download it either [here](http://miltonstanley.github.io/Quandrax/) and click on the download button at the top, or directly from [Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/quandrax/), which only includes the necessary files.
2. Unzip it, and remember where you put the folder.
3. Put your CK2 savegame (typically found in My Documents/Paradox folder) into the same folder as quandrax.exe
4. Double-click quandrax.exe. You may be prompted for configuration options if this is your first time.
5. Move the newly created EU3 savegame into your EU3 folder (typically C:/Program Files/.../Europa Universalis 3/save games or similar).
6. Enjoy!

Features for version 2.0.0
--------------------------
- Advanced configuration options to make sure the savegame is compatible with your EU3 version as uses all features
- Converts the player information
- Sets the EU3 date as the same as your CK2 date
- Converts the Holy Roman Emperor, and checks if the last emperor was from the same nation (dynasty) as the current
- Converts the papal controller based on titles held, or highest relations with the pope otherwise
- Converts cardinals based on Court Chaplains (including name, location, and controller), using CK2 relations with the papal titleholder
- Converts province controllers, cores, cultures, religions, capitals, and discovery dates
- Converts nation capitals, monarchs (including names and CK2 coronation dates), religions, cultures, prestige, and cash
- Converts CK2 vassals based on your settings - either "blobbing" (annex provinces to top title), or as EU3 vassals (for annexation)
- Completely rewritten from scratch means a cleaner code base, faster additions, patches, features, etc.
