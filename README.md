This is the QUick ANd Dirty paRAdoX converter, a project to create a single, unified save game converter.

I will mainly be focusing on CK2 - EU3, as that's the biggest need - and from what I've seen, the other ones are pretty good.

I am primarily working on province controller conversions. Other things will be added later.

Please place requests as needed for features. 

The code is in Ruby.

Regards,
Milton
