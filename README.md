QUANDRAX
========
The QUick ANd Dirty paRAdoX converter.

What is Quandrax?
-----------------
It's a project to create a single, unified save game converter. Currently, it is primarily focused on CK2-EU3, as that seems to be the biggest need.

How Do I Use it?
----------------
0. Please note you MUST have the Ruby interpreter installed. You can download it here: http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/. It's worth it; Ruby is great, you'll find the joy of scripting when you start modding ANYTHING, and it's becoming popular enough it's worth having the interpreter installed.
1. Download it either from Github at https://github.com/MiltonStanley/Quandrax (click on the download ZIP button towards the top), or directly from Sourceforge at http://sourceforge.net/projects/quandrax/
2. Put your CK2 save game in the same folder as quandrax.rb, and then run Quandrax. It will create an EU3 save game with the same filename. Put this in your EU3 save game folder. 

If you don't want to do it yourself, or don't have Ruby installed, feel free to email me at quandraxproject@gmail.com. I will convert it for you and email it back.

How Can I Help?
---------------
By posting Issues, Fixes, Suggestions for Features, and so on in the issues tab.

Where's the Development version?
--------------------------------
In its own branch. Simpler that way.

TODO List
---------
1. Finish Quandrax 2.0.0 (in development) - complete rewrite, with complete province building (Need to compile complete feature list)
2. Get code ready for EU4 (woot!)
