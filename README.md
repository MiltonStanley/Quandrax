QUANDRAX
========
The QUick ANd Dirty paRAdoX converter.

What is Quandrax?
-----------------
It's a project to create a single, unified save game converter. Currently, it is primarily focused on CK2-EU3, as that seems to be the biggest need.

How Do I Use it?
----------------
1. Go into the Release folder, and choose the latest version. 
2. Put your CK2 save game in the same folder as quandrax.rb, and then run Quandrax. It will create an EU3 save game with the same filename. Put this in your EU3 save game folder. 

If you don't want to do it yourself, or don't have Ruby installed, feel free to email me at quandraxproject@gmail.com. I will convert it for you and email it back.

How Can I Help?
---------------
By posting Issues, Fixes, Suggestions for Features, and so on in the issues tab.

What's in the Development Directory?
------------------------------------
The latest (unstable) version, in both Ruby and C++ (for people who don't have Ruby installed [but you should all install Ruby, as it's great]).

TODO List
---------
0. Develop config file to get rid of issues with incorrect game versions/expansions
1. Finish Quandrax 2.0.0 (in development) - complete rewrite, with complete province building
2. Get code ready for EU4 (woot!)
