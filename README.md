# What is Quandrax?

   This is the QUick ANd Dirty paRAdoX converter, a project to create a single,
   unified save game converter. Currently, it is primarily focused on CK2-EU3,
   as that seems to be the biggest need.

## How does it work?

   Load the CK2 savegame into the same folder as Quandrax, along with any other
   files Quandrax comes with. Run Quandrax, and you'll have a new EU3 savegame
   called "conversion.eu3". Place that in your EU3 save folder, and you're done!

## What's left to do on the project?

   Nothing! We're beta testing
