This is the QUick ANd Dirty paRAdoX converter, a project to create a single, unified save game converter.

I will mainly be focusing on CK2 - EU3, as that's the biggest need - and from what I've seen, the other ones are pretty good.

I am primarily working on province controller conversions. Other things will be added later.

tag_manual_adder.rb either returns the amount of work left to do (if run with -d or -debug flag), or walks you through adding tags to the tag map.

tag_map.rb is hash of title => tag that is completed.

tags.rb is an Array of legal tags used for error checking.

Check the wiki for a list of titles and tags used to build the array and hash.

Please place requests as needed for features. 

The code is in Ruby.

Regards,
Milton
