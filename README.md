QUANDRAX
========
The QUick ANd Dirty paRAdoX converter.

What is Quandrax?
-----------------
Quandrax is the program to create a single, unified save game converter for the fantastic suite of historical strategy games published by Paradox Interactive. Currently, it is primarily focused on CK2-EU3, as that seems to be the biggest need.

What's New?
-----------
- Cleaner code base allows faster additions, patches, features, etc.
- More advanced configuration options
- More advanced conversion options

How Do I Use it?
----------------
1. As of version 2.0.0, a bundled .exe file will eliminate the need to install the Ruby interpreter.
2. Download it either from Github at https://github.com/MiltonStanley/Quandrax (click on the download ZIP button towards the top), or directly from Sourceforge at http://sourceforge.net/projects/quandrax/
3. Put your CK2 save game in the same folder as quandrax.exe, and then run Quandrax. It will create an EU3 save game with the same filename. 
4. Put this in your EU3 save game folder (typically C:/Program Files/.../Europa Universalis 3/save games)
