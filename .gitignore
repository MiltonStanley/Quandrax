# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global

# Ignore my test file
*.ck2
*.eu3

# Don't need config file
config_file.txt

# Don't need my output file from testing
a.out
