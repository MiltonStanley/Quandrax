{"name":"Quandrax","tagline":"The Quick and Dirty Paradox Converter","body":"What is Quandrax?\r\n-----------------\r\nQuandrax is the program to create a single, unified save game converter for the fantastic suite of historical strategy games published by Paradox Interactive. Currently, it is primarily focused on CK2-EU3, as that seems to be the biggest need.\r\n\r\nWhat's New?\r\n-----------\r\n- Cleaner code base allows faster additions, patches, features, etc.\r\n- More advanced configuration options\r\n- More advanced conversion options\r\n\r\nHow Do I Use it?\r\n----------------\r\n1. As of version 2.0.0, a bundled .exe file will eliminate the need to install the Ruby interpreter.\r\n2. Download it directly from Sourceforge at http://sourceforge.net/projects/quandrax/, or at the above link.\r\n3. Put your CK2 save game in the same folder as quandrax.exe, and then run Quandrax. It will create an EU3 save game with the same filename. \r\n4. Put this in your EU3 save game folder (typically C:/Program Files/.../Europa Universalis 3/save games)\r\n\r\nHow Can I Help?\r\n---------------\r\nBy posting Issues, Fixes, Suggestions for Features, and so on in the issues tab, the Quandrax blog posts in the ParadoxPlaza website, OR in the appropriate forum threads.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
